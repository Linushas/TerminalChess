# TerminalChess (work in progress)
Play chess using notation. Make a move by first typing the square where the piece you want to move is located, followed with the destination square. To castle king-side, enter *0-0* and to castle queen-side, enter *0-0-0*.

Ex) *e2e4* moves the piece located at *e2* to *e4*.

## Building and running:
1. Add path to project at the end of [build_template](./build_template.sh)
2. ```./build_template.sh``` in project directory
